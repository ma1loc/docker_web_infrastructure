# Inception – Docker Web Infrastructure (still working on it)

## Overview

Inception is a system administration and DevOps–oriented project from **1337 School**. The goal is to build a complete web infrastructure using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**, following strict rules and best practices.

This project focuses on understanding how containers work together to form a reliable and scalable environment, rather than relying on prebuilt images or shortcuts.

## What I Learned

* Docker fundamentals and container lifecycle
* Writing optimized and secure Dockerfiles
* Using Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple services
* Building a web stack from scratch (NGINX, MariaDB, WordPress)
* Managing environment variables and secrets
* Understanding volumes, networks, and container isolation

## Technologies Used

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* NGINX
* MariaDB
* WordPress
* Linux (Debian-based images)

## Detailed Explanation

I documented my full learning journey in a Medium article, covering everything from the basics of Docker to the final project requirements:

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

* A practical implementation of Docker-based infrastructure
* A reference for students working on the Inception project
* A learning record of my DevOps journey
